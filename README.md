# Clock Module

The idea behind this project is to have a standalone clock circuit to debug ICs at a very low clock speed.

It is mainly inspired by [Ben Eater's](https://eater.net/8bit/clock) version.


### Features
- Manual pulse Mode.
- Variable frequency clock.
- DC Input Jack 7v - 15v @ approx. 100mA.
- Raw 5v power in for easy breadboard use.


### Todo
- Get a 5vpp output instead of a 3vpp
- Add partslist
